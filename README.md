Creating a client server application that provides security at two levels of security, at the first level encrypt the message at the client side and send the same to the server where the server decrypts it and stores in a local file in its own encrypted. For the above scenario simulating the communication for a wireless scenario

At the Client-Side:
Client has to enter the message 
At the Server-Side:
Server has to decrypt the message recieved from the client and again encrypt it and save the encrypted message and key into the file.
